<img class="banner-image" src="./philos.png" alt="an image depicting 6 philosophers wondering how to eat"/>

# 1. Getting started 
A table of 5 philosophers are seated at a round table.<br/>

They all have a fork in front of them and a huge plate of pasta in the middle of the table.<br/>

They must eat or they will die. They must sleep or they will die.<br/>

To eat, one needs two forks - which means he'll have to borrow a neighbour's fork.<br/>

He will instantly starts sleeping after having eaten.<br/>

They are bound to this round table.<br/><br/>

How to keep them all alive ?


## 1.1 The code
Each philosopher is a thread in a multi-thread program. <br/>
Every fork is protected by a mutex (which prevents the same fork from being held by two threads) <br/><br/>
The program outputs the actions of every thread as they perform these actions.<br/>
If a philosopher dies, the program stops.<br/>

## 1.2 Installation 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lpellier/philosophers.git && cd philosophers/philo
$ make
```

# 2. Usage
```bash
# Execute philosophers
$ ./philoshopers <nbr_of_philos> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep>
```
